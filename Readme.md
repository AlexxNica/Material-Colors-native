# Material Colors Native

Material Colors Native App for OSX

Heavily inspired by [MaterialColorsApp
](https://github.com/romannurik/MaterialColorsApp).

Build with [react-native-desktop
](https://github.com/ptmt/react-native-desktop).

# Why ?

To test react-native-desktop and also MaterialColorsApp is OSX only so why use Electron ? It produce a ~114 Mo app vs ~4 Mo for the native one.
